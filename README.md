Baby's first django project!

This was our group's first experience trying to develop using django, and so we found as many tutorials online as we could and tried to scrap something together. Without further ado, we present... 

# STREETSTAGRAM!


Users can submit a photo of a local work of street art with an address and description. The end goal is to aggregate and map out points of interest provide a one-stop shop for interested adventurers to seek out hidden gems to explore. 

### Further points for development (that we couldn't figure out in time for our hackathon submission): 
- Moderation (admin approval before submissions can show up on the site)
- user/client authentication


### how to run:
 - a virtual environment should be included in the repo. activate it (streetstagram) and run `python(3) manage.py runserver`. If you get an error message, try using the `pip install -r requirements.txt` instruction after activating the virtual enviroment to update dependencies. Then, in your browser, access http://127.0.0.1:8000; to submit something and have it show up in the gallery, access http://127.0.0.1:8000/django-form-upload-art; to play with an interactive map of New Haven with art labeled, access http://127.0.0.1:8000/map.
 - our brains are fried and we may have missed some links or typed out the command incorrectly. Run the server as you would normally run a django server locally :) thank you for your understanding
